# youtube_comments_analysis

A small program that uses Jupyter Notebook to analyse the comment sections of specific youtube videos.

It requires a youtube API key, and the ID of the video who's comments are to be loaded.

After downloading several comment sections and saving them as ```.csv``` files, the ```csv_analyse.ipynb``` can be used
to see which users commented on multiple videos, which comments appear at least twice accross videos, etc.
